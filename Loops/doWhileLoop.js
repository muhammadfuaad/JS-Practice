// The do-while loop is used when you want to ensure that the code inside the loop executes at least once, 
// regardless of whether the condition is true or false. The structure is as follows
// do {
//     // code to be executed
// } while (condition);

{let i = 1;
  do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  } while (i < 5);
